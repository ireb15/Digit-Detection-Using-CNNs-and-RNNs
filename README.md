Once run the model will automatically get the MNIST dataset and start training and testing the model.
At the end of this, Output graphs of Loss, Trainging accuracy and testing accuracy is shown. 
Following this, the confusion matrix is printed along with a classification report which includes f1 score for each class and accuracy.

How to use Model 4:
